# 🚀 QUICK START - Test Your Application NOW

## ⚡ 3-Minute Test

### 1. **Check Servers Are Running**

**Backend (Port 5000):**
```bash
# Should show server process
lsof -i :5000
```

**Frontend (Port 5174):**
```bash
# Should show vite process  
lsof -i :5174
```

**If not running:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd /home/ghostblaster/Projects/CC-mini-project/server
node server.js

# Terminal 2: Frontend
cd /home/ghostblaster/Projects/CC-mini-project/client
npm run dev
```

### 2. **Open Application**
```
http://localhost:5174
```

### 3. **Register New Account**
- Click "Get Started" or go to: http://localhost:5174/register
- Fill in:
  - Name: **Test User**
  - Email: **test@example.com**
  - Password: **test123**
  - Role: **Patient**
- Click "Register"

### 4. **You Should See Dashboard Immediately**
After registration, you should be auto-redirected to dashboard showing:
- Welcome message with your name
- Active Medications: 0
- Adherence Rate: 0%
- Total Prescriptions: 0
- Upload Prescription button

### 5. **If Dashboard Doesn't Show**

**Open Browser Console (F12) and check for:**

✅ **Good signs:**
```
✅ Login successful! User: {...}
👤 Navigating to patient dashboard
```

❌ **Bad signs:**
```
❌ Network Error
❌ Failed to fetch
❌ 401 Unauthorized
```

---

## 🎯 Expected Flow

### **Registration → Dashboard (AUTOMATIC)**
```
1. Fill registration form
2. Click "Register"
3. See "Registration successful!" message
4. AUTOMATIC redirect to /dashboard
5. See your name in welcome message
```

**Total time: 2-3 seconds**

### **Login → Dashboard (AUTOMATIC)**
```
1. Fill login form
2. Click "Login"  
3. See "Login successful!" message
4. AUTOMATIC redirect to /dashboard
5. See your dashboard content
```

**Total time: 1-2 seconds**

---

## 🐛 If Stuck on Login/Register Page

### **Quick Fix 1: Manual Navigation**
After clicking Login/Register, manually go to:
```
http://localhost:5174/dashboard
```

If you see the dashboard, the redirect is broken (but auth works).

### **Quick Fix 2: Check Console Logs**
I added detailed logging. In browser console you should see:
```
🔐 Attempting login with: test@example.com
📡 AuthContext: Sending login request...
📡 AuthContext: Login response: {success: true, ...}
💾 Saving to localStorage - Token: exists
💾 Saving to localStorage - User: {...}
✅ AuthContext: User state updated
✅ Login successful! User: {...}
👤 Navigating to patient dashboard
```

### **Quick Fix 3: Clear and Retry**
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear()
location.reload()
```

Then register a NEW account with different email.
